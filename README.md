# FixIT App

FixIT App was created for the Faculty of Engineering in Shubra in Egypt.
To maintain faults within the college by creating a problem and entering all its details in terms of the building, floor, room, type of fault, uploading a picture of the fault, etc.
Then this problem is assigned to the specialized maintenance technician, and after the problem is repaired by the technician, the status of the problem being resolved is updated
